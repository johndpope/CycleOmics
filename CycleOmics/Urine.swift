        "2) It is important to clean the genitalia before collecting urine. Bacteria and cells from the surrounding skin can contaminate the sample and interfere with the interpretation of test results. With women, menstrual blood and vaginal secretions can also be a source of contamination. Women should spread the labia of the vagina and clean from front to back; men should wipe the tip of the penis.\n\n" +
        "3) Collect midstream. Start to urinate, let some urine fall into the toilet, then collect one to two ounces of urine in the container provided, then void the rest into the toilet. This type of collection is called a \"midstream collection\" or a \"clean catch.\"" +
        "4) Aliquot and store without delay. As soon as the collection finishes, the urine sample should be transferred into a 200 ul and 1 ml aliquots (per sample) with 2D-labled tubes using a plastic pipet. Discard the plastic pipet after use." +
